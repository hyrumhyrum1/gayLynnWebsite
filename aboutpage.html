        <h2>Meet Our Candidate</h2>
        <hr class = "subhr">
        <p>Gay Lynn grew up in Holladay and graduated from Skyline High School.  She served a mission to Mexico City and enjoys speaking Spanish. She graduated from BYU cum laude with a Bachelor’s degree in English.  She and her husband, Jim, have been married 34 years. Right after graduation, Jim joined the Air Force and they moved to Washington, D.C. where Jim attended medical school and Gay Lynn worked for a mortgage company and then the medical school. </p>
        <p>As Jim’s service in the Air Force began, they moved around the country so their children were born in Washington D.C., Oklahoma, Michigan, and  Georgia.  During these years, Gay Lynn kept the family together, served in schools, marching bands and church callings and came to love people and communities around the nation.</p>
        <p>Jim retired in 2012 and with one son still at home, they moved back to Utah.  A friend connected Gay Lynn with Women’s State Legislative Council, and her 7 years involvement with this 100 year old non-partisan group working for the best legislation for Utah has served as an education in our legislative process, our legislators and the critical issues our community and state face moving forward. </p>
        <p>For the past 5 years, Gay Lynn has also volunteered teaching English to immigrants and refugees through English Skills Learning Center and volunteered in other organizations for the public welfare.  She has served in Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts and other great organizations for children.</p>

        <h2>A Word from Gay Lynn</h2>
        <hr class = "subhr">
        <p>The healthy, loving family I grew up in is the foundation for the happy life I enjoy.  I relish hiking, biking and skiing. Our mountains and valleys are destinations for travelers world-wide which we can enjoy daily.  Our careful stewardship of these lands and wildlife will preserve them for our children and cleaner air will encourage businesses to come here.</p>
        <p>As I walk, I feel my heart full of energy and joy.  When I consider why, I know it’s because of the people in my life—the refugee from North Korea learning how to drive, our neighbors who help each other with challenges, our children who don’t let the miles between them interfere with their relationships.  </p>
        <p>Public education has been our family’s life line as we have moved around the country.  Band camp was where our children made good friends in a new state, and teachers who cared have made a difference for each of our four children in times of transition.  Public education is the basis for our democracy and deserves the support that the majority of Utahns demand.</p>
        <p>There is a disconnect between what we as a community envision and the reality of some laws in Utah.  Why can pay day lenders charge up to 222% on loans and entrap our neighbors in debt?</p>
        <p>​When our legislators passed the 2019 Tax Reform, why wasn’t increased pay for teachers a part of the discussion?  My seven years serving with Women’s State Legislative Council has allowed me to observe our legislature in action and helped me understand the complex issues we face.  I am eager to listen to you and be your voice in this important process that makes our state and country the best in the world, the place where everyone wants to live.  </p>

        <h2>Refugees in Utah</h2>
        <hr class = "subhr">
        <p>With COVID-19 presently occupying most of our attention, it's easy to forget that 1% of the world's population are refugees. Having concerns for these people, five years ago I began volunteering to teach English to refugees and immigrants. My interactions with these brave souls, many of whom have left their homelands due to the ravages of war or risk of life, have brought me tremendous joy. I have taught students from Bhutan to Brazil, North Korea to Iraq, to help them learn skills and make friends that will help them become productive members of our community. My favorite memory is of women from China, Russia, and Iran who went  shopping together after class.</p>
