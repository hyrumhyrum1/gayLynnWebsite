She believes in people and in working with people to bring out the best in our community. As an educator for over 16 years, I proudly endorse Gay Lynn Bennion as a representative who will put our children's education first and foremost. She believes in public education and supports proper funding for education so our teachers are paid their worth, our students are provided with the necessary technology and supplies to make them competitive in today's global market, and our schools have the funding to ensure every child has equal opportunities for learning and are provided with a safe nurturing learning environment.
