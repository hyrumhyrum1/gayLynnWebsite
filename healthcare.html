            Healthcare accessibility and costs are still the #1 priority for Utahns, as studies have found 
            since 2016. Currently, many people are worried about losing jobs and know this also means losing 
            their healthcare insurance. Ninety percent of Utah employees work for small businesses, defined 
            as less than 500 employees. For many small business employees, health insurance costs are prohibitive. 
            In 2018, Medicaid Expansion (Prop. 3) was supported by 65% of voters in our district. The legislature 
            weakened the proposition, making it more expensive and narrowing it to cover less people. Utahns recognize 
            that we need to be healthy in order to work, and I will work for equitable, accessible, affordable 
            healthcare for all Utahns. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2018 our state legislature commissioned a study of health disparities by legislative district. The 
            report came out last year with important findings. Within our district (HD46), we have wide healthcare 
            disparities. A “disparity” implies that the difference is avoidable, unfair, and unjust. We range from 
            areas where less than 3% of people have no healthcare insurance to areas where 20% have no healthcare 
            insurance. In one area, 10% of adults are reporting poor mental health, and in another area 25% report 
            poor mental health. Drug poisoning death rates per 100,000 people range from 18 to 38 in different areas 
            within our district. I care about all citizens of our district and will actively work with the health 
            department to find solutions to address these disparities. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Utah has some of the highest national rates of suicide and other mental health challenges, with up to 
            a third of adults in some areas dealing with depression. Recent legislation has created mental health 
            crisis receiving centers and mobile crisis outreach teams. These are tremendous improvements. I will 
            work to ensure these programs receive adequate funding and that we continue to find innovative ways to 
            address our mental health needs.
        </p>

            In April when we focused on wearing masks and social distancing, our transmission rates of COVID-19 were 
            lower than they are today. Following guidance from health experts could have led to sustained lower 
            transmission rates and prepared us better for opening schools this fall. Free contact tracing apps have 
            been offered to our state and haven’t been accepted. I listen to subject experts and will always work for 
            transparency, open bids, and the best options possible.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our legislature has passed bills improving our ability to see how much procedures cost, but are citizens 
            aware of this and able to find the information they need? How can we improve our ability to see costs before 
            an expensive procedure and shop for the best fit?  Part of the answer is being proactive as patients. 
            Several hospitals now offer costs estimates for non-urgent procedures. As I speak with residents of our 
            district, I hear transparency of health costs is a concern, and I will continue looking for improvements.
