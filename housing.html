            COVID-19 and low interest rates have created bidding wars in Utah's housing market. 
            Rising housing costs could damage the economy as employees and our children can't afford to live here. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Utah currently has the 3rd most competitive housing market in the country, driven by a roughly 55,000-unit 
            housing shortage in everything from single-family homes to apartments. Low interest rates, targeted to help 
            businesses through COVID-19, have had the side-effect of exacerbating our already expensive, limited housing 
            market; low interest rates allow more buyers to enter the market and also increase the price they can 
            consider paying for a home. The result has been that bidding wars occur in 64% of home offers being made in 
            the Salt Lake metro area. Bids of $100,000 over the asking price have become a reality.
        </p>

        <p>
            In a June poll conducted for the Consumer Attitude Index among both individual Utahns and bank representatives, 
            60% of respondents said they believe rising home values are having negative effects on the state's economy. 
            With housing costs 20% higher here than in surrounding states, many workers are tempted to leave the state or 
            not come here in the first place, putting us at risk of losing our workforce. I am concerned so many of us 
            are cost-burdened as renters and home owners. With only 35% of households in Salt Lake County able to afford 
            a median-priced new single-family home, finding solutions to this problem is one of my priorities.
        </p>

        <p>
            Utah has finally begun to address this issue through investing in affordable housing, and more solutions are 
            possible and essential. The following are ways we can address this problem:
            <ul class = "body_list">
                <li>
                    Realizing the high cost of housing in our state, affordable housing advocates encouraged the 
                    2020 legislature to approve $35 million towards affordable housing units. Only $10 million was approved. 
                    These funds will be directed to low-interest gap financing loans for developers, which are estimated to 
                    help build about 1,400 new units and preserve existing affordable units. This is a start, but insufficient 
                    to meet our needs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Several Utah business leaders are working with the Utah Nonprofit Housing Corporation to create the new Utah 
                    Housing Preservation Fund, which aims to help preserve Utah’s existing affordable housing units so they 
                    aren’t sold, remodeled, and sold again at higher prices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Companies are being urged to consider providing housing for their workforces.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some states require disclosure of investors and shell companies to discourage these entities from buying 
                    properties that then sit vacant. Neutral information could disclose who is behind cash transactions and 
                    shell companies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The legislature can fund more affordable housing, incentivize local communities to implement land use 
                    policies that make housing affordable, focus significant economic development efforts to areas outside 
                    the Wasatch Front, and pass HD211, which would require landlords to disclose all rental costs.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
