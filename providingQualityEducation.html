            The state proficiency goal for 3rd graders to be able to read at grade level is 60%. 
            This leaves too many young children struggling—the bar needs to be raised. This year 
            the legislature invested in Upstart and other programs for young children. Due to potential 
            funding shortfalls, implementation of these programs may be delayed. But even in hard times 
            it is imperative we find a way to focus on early education. 
        </p>

            I have heard too many stories of teachers leaving the profession because they can’t afford to teach.
             But from teachers themselves, I hear them asking for more school therapists and resources to help 
             students. Rather than focusing on their own needs, teachers are looking at what students need most 
             to succeed. Even during a time of possible budget cuts, ways exist to maximize what is given to 
             support our teachers and students.
        </p>

            Local control, rather than state tests and grading of schools, is leading to success for struggling 
            schools. During the last three years, Rep. Marie Poulson promoted a​ bill to remove letter grades from
             state school reporting. This year it was approved unanimously by the House but not heard in the
              Senate. I hear support for this move from all sides, and I will continue to vigorously support 
              this initiative that Rep. Poulson started.

            I am attending meetings with our State School Board Superintendent and other educators to find the 
            answers to these questions.  Together, we’ll find the answers to the following questions:
            <ul class = "body_class">
                <li>How well prepared were we to conduct remote learning? Were teachers pedagogically and 
                    technologically up to speed to switch to on-line learning?</li>
                <li>How successful was remote learning?</li>
                <li>ow did remote learning affect those in lower economic circumstances or remote areas who may 
                    not have had access to needed technology?</li>
                <li>What positives came from remote learning that we may be able to leverage to improve (and perhaps 
                    get cost savings) the delivery of education?</li>
            </ul>
