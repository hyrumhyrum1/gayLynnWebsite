            When the interest rate rose from 11% in 1979 to 20% in 1981, 
            I witnessed the devastating impact these rates had on businesses and families. 
            Our state government’s actions at this time can either help or hinder all of us 
            as we navigate through our current health and business challenges. In early 2020, 
            Salt Lake County unemployment was at an historic low of 2.3%, but now the global 
            pandemic has disrupted lives and businesses. We can avoid a double-dip recession 
            if we prioritize testing, follow public health guidance, continue to innovate, and 
            pursue wise public policies.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our current health and business challenges bring attention to depressed wages in our county.
             Though inflation-adjusted wages have not increased, the cost of living has increased 256% 
             since 1982. Salt Lake County is less affordable than the national average. Many individuals 
             and families were feeling economically pressured even before March. We need to find ways to 
             reverse these trends.
        </p>

            Increased automation and artificial intelligence (AI) are upon us. Thankfully, Salt Lake County 
            has been studying our economy and recently released the Automation Brief Report. This report finds 
            our county better prepared than most for changes due to automation because of our educated workforce 
            with diverse skills. Government has a role to play in preparing us for increasing automation by
             providing quality education and facilitating transitions to new job opportunities. The report finds 
             “growing pains in the short term can be mitigated through thoughtful public and private policies to 
             address likely outcomes.”
